This repository contains my R code file. 

 After reformatting the dataset, the file is split up into two main sections: binary classification and multiclass classification.
 
 Binary classification contains sampling, training, and tuning a Random Forest algorithm and the changes in accuracies. 
 
 Multiclass classification contains the sampling process, as well as training KNN, LDA, and Random Forest algorithms and their respective accuracies. 
 
 Finally, at the ends of both of these sections are codes that writes the predictions into a final txt file for submission.
 
 The entire rmd should run smoothly from top to bottom as long as the training and test files are downloaded and the corresponding packages for the ML algorithms.
