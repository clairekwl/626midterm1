This repository contains my R code file. 

 After reformatting the dataset, the file is split up into two main sections: binary classification and multiclass classification.
 
 Binary classification contains sampling, training, and tuning a Random Forest algorithm and the changes in accuracies.
 
 Multiclass classification contains the sampling process, as well as training KNN, LDA, and Random Forest algorithms and their respective accuracies.
